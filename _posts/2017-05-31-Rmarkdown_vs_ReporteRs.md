I prefer `Rmarkdown` to `ReporteRs` because of its capability to convert one format to the other formats such as html and latex-pdf.

However `pandoc` (i.e. `Rmarkdown`)'s support for docx is not so great, so I had to use `ReporteRs` sometimes and it was a pain when I first used it. 

Now I get used to it and I should admit that it is actually a pretty powerful tool for reproducible generation of docx documents.
