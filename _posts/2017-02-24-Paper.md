This is a paper based on the lab work I did in NIH back in 2012 and I am so happy to see it published although it's little complicated to understand.

["The effects of interleukin-2 on immune response regulation"](https://academic.oup.com/imammb/article/3038032/The-effects-of-interleukin-2-on-immune-response?searchresult=1)

Most importantly, now I got Erdos number and the more surprisingly it's 4.
