I unintentionally git-added a large file and commited it but when I tried to git-push, the terminal showed this error message.

```shell
remote: error: GH001: Large files detected. You may want to try Git Large File Storage - https://git-lfs.github.com.
remote: error: Trace: 6a3f08cbe29a3e7861210de4bf21caf6
remote: error: See http://git.io/iEPt8g for more information.
remote: error: File lib/RP/NCA-Theoph.rtf is 113.09 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB
```

Github allows the file size less then 100mb to be uploaded so I had to remove the file after adding the directory to the `.gitignore`.

However, the git-push was still unavailable because git records every file-related action so I found this answer. <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17382375/github-file-size-limit-changed-6-18-13-cant-push-now>

```
git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch lib/RP/NCA-Theoph.rtf' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

Problem solved!
