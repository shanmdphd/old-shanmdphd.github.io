Remarkable!

AWS indeed provides a totally new perspective how softwares work in the internet.

I was really shocked today.

You can run Rstudio through AWS with a help of this article. <https://aws.amazon.com/ko/blogs/big-data/running-r-on-aws/>

I updated some bash codes of latest version of Rstudio server and Shiny server according to the Rstudio website as shown below.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#install R
yum install -y R

#install RStudio-Server
#https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/
wget https://download2.rstudio.org/rstudio-server-rhel-1.0.136-x86_64.rpm
yum install -y --nogpgcheck rstudio-server-rhel-1.0.136-x86_64.rpm

#install shiny and shiny-server
#https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/download-server/
R -e "install.packages('shiny', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')"
wget https://download3.rstudio.org/centos5.9/x86_64/shiny-server-1.5.3.838-rh5-x86_64.rpm
yum install -y --nogpgcheck shiny-server-1.5.3.838-rh5-x86_64.rpm

#add user(s)
useradd your_username
echo your_username:your_password | chpasswd
```
